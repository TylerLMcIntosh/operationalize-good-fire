# Good fire in western U.S. forests: estimating the beneficial ecosystem work of wildfires

This repository contains code, data, and graphics to accompany {ADD CITATION & DOI HERE ONCE PUBLISHED}

## Contents

This repository is intended to support research reproduction according to principles of Open Science and FAIR data principles.

Analyses require use of Google Earth Engine and R.

To clone this repo to your workspace: 
``` git clone https://github.com/TylerLMcIntosh/a-number-on-good-fire ```

Scripts in the /code directory are ordered from 00 on up, and are meant to be run in order. Scripts with 'a' before the number manage wildfire event data manipulation and summarization prior to data merge, while scripts with 'b' before the number manage prescribed burn event data manipulation and summarization. Scripts with neither 'a' or 'b' are the core analysis scripts used after all data are prepared for analysis.

Javascript scripts (.js) are meant to be run on Google Earth Engine (GEE); each contains a link to the online version of the working script.

R scripts (.R) are used for data management.

Quarto documents (.qmd) are used for creation of final publication figures.

A list and description of all scripts is included below.

## Script descriptions

### Wildfire event manipulation and severity workflow
- a00_create_goodfire_event_dataset.R : This script merges data from the MTBS & Welty&Jeffries fire event datasets into a single main dataset
- a01_generate_gf_cbi.js: This script uses GEE to calculate region-wide CBI layers for the goodfire event dataset created in a00
- a02_full_streamlined_good_fire.js : This GEE script generates good fire layers from the CBI layers derived in the last script and summarizes the data for any set of summary polygons. It also outputs per-event statistics. All outputs go to user's Google Drive in the specified folder.
- a03_merge_gf_gdrive_data.R : This script pulls outputs from GEE (GDrive) to the user's local machine and merges the annualized data for further use. It also accesses the remote per-event statistics. All data are written out locally for analysis using core scripts.

### Prescribed burn event manipulation workflow
- 00b_prep_rx_for_gee.R : This script prepares NFPORS RX data for use in GEE
- 01b_add_gee_data_to_rx.js : This GEE script adds Fire Regime Group and landcover data to the prescribed burn event data
- 02b_merge_summarize_rx_data.R : This script pulls in outputs from GEE and merges the new data with the raw spatial NFPORS data. It also cleans the data and then writes out summaries.

### Core analysis workflow
- 00_create_plots.qmd : This quarto document creates and exports all figures for the publication
